CKLD-1#1 Warning
Clock Net has non-BUF driver and too many loads  
Clock net system_i/processing_system7_0/inst/FCLK_CLK0 is not driven by a Clock Buffer and has more than 512 loads. Driver(s): system_i/processing_system7_0/inst/PS7_i/FCLKCLK[0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-15#1 Warning
Large hold violation on inter-clock path  
There is a large inter-clock skew of 1.934 ns between system_i/ps7_0_axi_periph/s00_couplers/auto_pc/inst/gen_axilite.gen_b2s_conv.axilite_b2s/RD.ar_channel_0/ar_cmd_fsm_0/state_reg[1]/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and system_i/ps7_0_axi_periph/s00_couplers/auto_pc/inst/gen_axilite.gen_b2s_conv.axilite_b2s/RD.ar_channel_0/cmd_translator_0/wrap_cmd_0/wrap_cnt_r_reg[0]/D (clocked by clk_fpga_0) that results in large hold timing violation(s) of -1.148 ns. Fixing large hold violations during routing might impact setup slack and result in more difficult timing closure
Related violations: <none>
